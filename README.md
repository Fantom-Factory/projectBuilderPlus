## What is Project Builder Plus?

PB+ is a tool for creating SkySpark projects with the following features:

 - Connects to Niagara with obix to generate haystack DB
 - Generate nHaystack import DB
 - Push to DB to SKySpark

PB+ usage is explained in these [tutorial videos](http://wiki.bassg.com/display/PBP).

John Petze had the following to say about PB+, from the [Project Haystack Forum](http://project-haystack.org/forum/topic/467):

> The PB+ editor makes it easy to work on large trend data files from your desktop, adding Project-Haystack tagging and custom extensions in preparation for importing data into analytics and visualization applications.

> PB+ accepts building operational data as raw XML and CSV files and exports Project-Haystack-compliant ZINC files. From the editor screen you can assign Haystack tags and extend tags with batch oriented tools. PB+ has options to communicate with NHaystack, Project-Haystackâ€™s open-source Niagara AX module, and with oBIX (Open Building Information Exchange) compatible databases. These connectors can be extended to Modbus, BACnet, and other standard building protocols.

> PB+ is a very comprehensive tool developed based on over 4 years of use in real world applications. Developers can create new connectors to other protocols and data sources popular in their specific domain. The Apache LuceneTM  text search engine is built-in, so that users can easily search for specific records or by specific tags in any database built with PB+.

If you find PB+ useful, then please give back to the [Project Haystack](http://project-haystack.org/) community!
